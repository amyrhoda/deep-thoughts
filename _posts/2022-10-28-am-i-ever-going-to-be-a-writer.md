title: Will I Ever Properly Be a Writer?
published: true
---

"Am I ever really going to properly be a writer? Or will I just pussyfoot around it for the rest of my life and then die?"

That question came to me yesterday. Not in a despairing way, not in a judgmental way, not in a rhetorical way. It came to me in an entirely curious way, as if I were watching my life from the outside, like a movie: 

"Will our protagonist ever get serious about her writing? Or will she die without getting around to it? How's this one going to end?"

#### I feel like I should be a writer.

I feel like I should be a writer.

This is not an unusual feeling. Just this morning I was talking to a friend and she said, "I should have been a writer." I don't know why the past tense, it's not like she's on her deathbed, but that's not the point. The point is, a lot of people feel like they "should" be a writer, or they're *really* a writer but they somehow got distracted by being an accountant or a lawyer. They definitely have a book in them which they will write when they have time, when they retire, when they get a chance.

Feeling like I should be a writer means next to nothing.

#### I'm already a writer

I'm already a writer. I write.

I'm writing this, right now. 

I write personal blog posts, and business blog posts, and essays for my newsletter. 

So what do I mean by "properly be a writer", if what I already do isn't enough?

Do I want more readers? If I wrote blog posts that were read by hundreds or thousands of people, instead of dozens, would that make me a proper writer?

Do I want more recognition? If I were on the radio or podcasts or YouTube being interviewed about my writing, would that make me a proper writer?

Do I want more money? (More than none, that is?) If I got paid for writing, would that make me a proper writer?

Do I want the third-party validation of being published? If my writing was published on someone else's blog, or a magazine, or as a book by a publishing company, would that make me a proper writer?

Do I want to take myself seriously as a writer? If I dedicated more time to writing, and worked harder on it, would that make me a proper writer?

#### Does the world need my writing?

I'm a middle-aged white lady going through a big life change. Oh goodness why isn't anyone talking about this? 

I'm being sarcastic. Every middle-aged white lady going through a big life change seems to write a book about it. Every possible take has already beeing taken. What can I add?

There's an argument that everyone has something new to add, and that you (you-everyone) should definitely make your art or write your songs or whatever because your take is unique and valuable just because it's yours and you are unique and valuable. And I believe that.

I believe that, to a point. But there's a difference between making your art and taking up a lot of space with it. It's a fact that certain kinds of people (white, male, rich) take up too much space in the world, with their art and their opinions and their takes. I don't want to be part of that problem.

Is that just a handy excuse for me, a nice progressive-looking way to avoid discomfort?

Maybe, but it could also be true.

#### What next?

What would it take to properly be a writer? What would it take to satisfy *myself* that I'm properly being a writer?

The first step would be to figure out what I need to feel like a proper writer, given that, as I said before, I'm already technically a writer.

Do I need to be published? Do I need to be read by more people? Win an award? Earn lots of money? (God help me if that's it.) 

And then, it takes the same thing it takes to make any kind of change in life: new habits, new skills, and new structure.

I'd need to figure out what skills, habits and structure I need to develop. Then I'd need to commit to doing whatever it would take to develop them, and I'd need to persist until I made the thing happen â€” or I died, whichever comes first.

But first, before all of those things, I'd need to decide to do it. 

I'd need to decide that this is a thing that's important enough to really work on, to face whatever demons and obstacles are in the way. I'd need to decide to take it seriously.

And that's the part I haven't done yet.

#### I still don't know

I don't have an answer for my question, of whether I'm ever going to properly be a writer, or if I'm going to pussyfoot around it until I die.

I don't even know what it would take for me to decide. 

There's a very good chance that I'll keep on putting this off, not making the decision, until I die. I'm already 47, after all. I've put it off this long.

Watch this space, I guess.
