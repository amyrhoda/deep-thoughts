title: The Trouble with Time Off

I'm about to do something that scares me.

I'm about to take three weeks off.

I know. What's so scary about that? I'm a huge proponent of rest and leisure. I love time off — in theory.

But I suck at it. When I can't travel, which is usually, time off makes me miserable, listless, and frustrated.

So I'm scared of these three weeks yawning ahead of me.

### It's not the rest, it's the fun

My problem with time off isn't about rest. I'm awesome at rest, even when I'm not taking time off. My problem is with recreation — fun. I suck at fun.

I think I have two problems with fun.

### My repertoire of activities is out of date

I swear I used to be better at fun. A couple of things have changed in the last few years, and I haven't kept up.

#### Fun is different in the time of plague

Before the pandemic, I used to do karaoke, go to restaurants, cafes, museums and libraries, hang out at the mall, and even travel sometimes. 

I'm writing this in Toronto's seventh wave of the COVID pandemic — the one everyone is pretending isn't happening. But it is happening, and I don't intend to get COVID in this wave or any other, so I won't do any of those indoor things.

Through most of the pandemic I've kept busy working and keeping my family and house sorted out. I didn't have the experience of my work stopping or moving online. So I never picked up a cute pandemic outdoor activity, like rollerskating or hiking. I also never picked up a cute pandemic indoor activity, like tending houseplants or making bread.

That leaves me with going for walks (but I don't leave the neighbourhood) or staying home to read, write, or do housework. Pretty sad. I need some new things.

#### My outer children are busy

So why not just go out and do something interesting? It's summer, there are plenty of outdoor things to do.

The problem is that my kids grew up. 

I used to hang out with my kids a lot, especially over summer vacation. We had adventures, big and small, and every week was full of activity. I had so much fun with my kids.

I figured out (in therapy, yesterday) that hanging out with my kids gave me permission to have fun and do things I would feel weird doing by myself, like going to the Ontario Science Centre or riding the carousel at Centre Island. 

But now my kids are older, and busy with their own things. If I want to have fun, I need to own it. I need to figure out what's fun for *me* (and my inner child) and I need to love myself (and my inner child) enough to actually do it.

(I love the idea of taking my inner child out on adventures, like a little imaginary friend.)

### I get purpose and service confused

The second problem with time off is that when I'm not working, I feel purposeless.

I love my work. When I'm tucked behind my desk with my books and my computer and my goals and my lists, I have purpose. I feel like my work makes the world better, in some small way.

And I'm not just doing my work for myself. People want me to write newsletters and host co-working sessions and lead coaching groups, and I'm happy to oblige. 

As you can see, my sense of purpose is very service oriented. I derive a sense of worth from doing things for other people. My need to feel like I'm of service makes it easy for me to tidy the house or work on book reviews or run errands instead of doing something just for me.

Even when I do rest or have fun, I often frame it in terms of restoring myself so I can get back to helping others. You know that oxygen mask metaphor, where you put the oxygen mask on yourself first so that you can help your kid put theirs on? I relate to that.

But the truth is, I get to have oxygen because I'm human and I need to breathe. I don't need to *earn* the right to breathe just so I can be alive to help someone else.

Easy to say.

### What to do differently?

What am I going to do differently in this three-week vacation so that I can have fun for the sake of fun — not to benefit my children, not to better myself or serve my clients, but purely to embrace creativity, pleasure, and joy?

I'm going to get quiet and listen to my inner child (I **know**, I roll my eyes too, but seriously she's in there) about what we want to do for fun.

I'm going to ride bikes. I'm going to visit the lake. I'm going to visit Centre Island and Riverdale Farm. I'm going to eat ice cream cones.

I'm going to put those fun activities on the calendar and I'm going to *actually do them*, even though sometimes I'm tired and it's hot and the only person I'm letting down by bailing is myself.

I'm going to make plans with friends.

I'm going to find an indoor hobby that *doesn't* involve reading or writing, something with colours. (I'm drawn to needlework, which is a great idea for a 47-year-old whose close vision is starting to go.)

See you in three weeks!
