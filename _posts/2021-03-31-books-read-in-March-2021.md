### *The Gown* by Jennifer Robson

This was a book club read, and actually it was my choice. I chose it because we wanted something light-ish (after a year of pandemic some of us are still not up to reading anything intense) but not fluffy. This fit the bill and was generally well-received by the other members.

The book is about being a woman in 1940s London, with the backdrop of World War II and the foreground of then-Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The characters were well-developed and the ideas were interesting. Some of the plot felt forced, particularly the connections to the modern day, but it didn't ruin the book.

All in all, enough to talk about to make this a good book club read, but not a book that I would thrust into anyone's hands unless they were particularly interested in the subject matter.

### *Do the Fucking Work* by Brian Buirge, Jason Bacher and Jason Richburg

Good advice, energetically given. Shouty, rude, and a little bit angry is my favourite kind of motivation, and this book delivers that. The advice isn't new to me (I've been reading this kind of book for years â€” it might well be new to you) but I am learning that there is great value in repetition, and in familiar lessons delivered in a new voice. It's all very well to know that you mustn't let fear get in the way of expressing yourself, or you should be yourself instead of trying to fit in, but to do it is difficult and reminders are always welcome. Always. Every day.

I have a couple of minor beefs.

This book was given to me by a friend who is just a little more sold on hustle culture than I am. (That is, he is slightly sold on it where I am totally skeptical.) This book is hustle culture-aligned, with glorification of long hours and urgings to squeeze every drop of yourself into your work. It's apparent that it was written by people with privilege, who don't have to reserve energy and time to look after others, manage chronic pain, or deal with racist security guards or street harassment on the way home. 

Just, read it accordingly. Don't feel like you're failing at art or life because you can't create like a 20-something white man.

And finally, silver text on glossy white paper is, ironically, a catastrophic design choice. This book is physically much harder to read than it should be. But it looks v cool.
