### *The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters* by Priya Parker

This is a book about event planning, party planning, but it's also a book about any kind of situation where we, the hosts, bring people together with purpose. It's deeply thoughtful but also full of clear and usable advice for every step along the way.

And along the way Parker talks about themes including leadership, authority, purpose, exclusion as a good thing, the power of vulnerability, and the problem with being chill. This book is thick with interesting ideas.

To be honest, the book also made me cringe in retrospect about the parties I've thrown. I love parties, but I have been a lazy host. I've often been guilty of throwing a party so I can be a guest at it, leaving my real guests to fend for themselves. I haven't taken advantage of the interstices — the time between invitation and arrival, between arrival and commencement, and between ending and departure — to enrich and deepen my guests' experience.

One thing is for sure: When I get back to throwing parties, they'll be a lot better and more *on purpose* than they used to be.

### *Your cleaner hates you and other poems* by Cathi Rae

I'm not a poetry reader, usually, so I don't know if my review counts for much. I bought this book because the author is an Instagram friend of mine, and I admire her intelligence, thoughtfulness, and style.

These are poems about life — about teaching, dogs, children, sex. The poems are also intelligent, thoughtful, and stylish. And they're not too hard — good for someone like me who takes things at face value. There is imagery and things are left unsaid, but it's not impenetrable.


### *All Systems Red* by Martha Wells

I loved this book. The protagonist is charming and relatable, and the mystery is well-crafted. I particularly enjoyed the protagonist's reflections as she (it?) gains a better understanding of humans, through bingeing soap operas and direct observation.

### *Watermark* by Christy-Ann Conlin

I really enjoyed this book, even though (again) I don't usually pick up collections of short stories. These ones are sometimes creepy, often surprising, and always grounded in strong, interesting characters. They'll stay with you after you put the book down.
