I'm Amy! I am trying to live life so I die with no regrets. I like people, challenges, and adventures. 

I try to do things for the right reasons, and so far the biggest challenge of my life has been distinguishing between what's important to me and what's important to everyone else.

### Work and Life

I am self-employed as a [strategy coach for artists and creative entrepreneurs](https://www.amyrhodabrown.com). I work with creative people who want to make a big change in their creative practice or business by helping them figure out the why and how, and follow through on the what.

I have children, I have cats, I have a house. I sing, go to concerts and go out dancing. I like working at cafes and libraries, and having long conversations with friends and strangers.
